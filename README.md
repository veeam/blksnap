## Kernel module
This kernel module implements snapshot and changed block tracking functionality.
The module is developed with the condition of simply adding it to the upstream.
Therefore, the module is divided into two parts: bdevfilter and blksnap.
bdevfilter provides the ability to intercept I/O units (bio). The main logic
is concentrated in blksnap. The upstream variant does not contain a bdevfilter,
but accesses the kernel to attach and detach the block device filter.

Relating the work in progress for integration in upstream kernel see the specific [README](https://github.com/veeam/blksnap/blob/master/doc/README-upstream-kernel.md)

### How to build
Installing the necessary deb packages.
``` bash
sudo apt install gcc linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```
Or installing the necessary rpm packages.
``` bash
sudo yum install gcc kernel-devel
```
``` bash
cd ./module
mk.sh build
```
In directory current directory you can found bdevfilter.ko and blksnap.ko.

### How to install
``` bash
cd ./module
mk.sh install
```
### How to create deb package
``` bash
sudo apt install debhelper dkms
# on debian >=12 and ubuntu >= 23.04 is needed dh-dkms, not installed anymore as dkms dep.
sudo apt install dh-dkms
cd ./pkg/deb
./build-blksnap-dkms.sh ${VERSION}
```
### How to create rpm package
There are several variants, look in the ./pkg/rpm directory.

## Tools
The blksnap tools allows you to manage the module from the command line.
The program allows for execution of individual ioctls of the blksnap module.
The interface of the program may seem inconvenient to the user,
since it is assumed that it will be called by other applications.
### How to build
See [how to build library, tools and tests](#how-to-build-library-tools-and-tests)

## Library
The dynamic C library is not needed to work with blksnap. File
./include/blksnap/blksnap.h contains everything you need to work with blksnap.
But to demonstrate how to call the ioctl, a static c++ library was created.
The library can also help you quickly create a working prototype.
In the project, the library is used for tests.
### How to build
See [how to build library, tools and tests](#how-to-build-library-tools-and-tests)

## Tests
The test scripts are written in bash and use the blksnap tool to control
the blksnap module. The test scripts allow to check the main functions of
the module. To implement complex test algorithms, ะก++ tests are implemented.
C++ tests use the static library libblksnap.a and it must be compiled to
build ะก++ tests.
### How to build
See [how to build library, tools and tests](#how-to-build-library-tools-and-tests)

### How to run all usage tests
``` bash
# change working directory to the tests one, for example for debian package is /opt/blksnap/tests
cd /opt/blksnap/tests
# execute all tests script
sudo ./all.sh
# or for logging the output to a file
sudo ./all.sh 2>&1 | tee -a /tmp/blksnap_test_$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S').log
```

## How to build library, tools and tests
Installing the necessary deb packages.
``` bash
sudo apt install g++ cmake uuid-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libssl-dev
```
Or installing the necessary rpm packages.
``` bash
sudo yum install g++ cmake libuuid-devel boost-static libstdc++-static openssl-static
```
Build.
``` bash
cmake .
make
```
Install (but it is recommended to use packages instead, for example the [debian](#how-to-create-dev-tools-and-tests-deb-packages) ones)
```
sudo make install
```
Uninstall (if needed)
```
sudo make uninstall
```

### How to create dev, tools and tests deb packages
``` bash
sudo apt install g++ cmake uuid-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libssl-dev debhelper
cd ./pkg/deb
./build-blksnap.sh ${VERSION}
```

## Compatibility notes
- blksnap kernel module support kernel versions from 5.10 up to 6.13
- all supported debian and ubuntu supported versions are supported but with some notes:
  - not all have debian/ubuntu versions have official packages of kernel >= 5.10, so an unofficial or custom ones more updated are needed, with blksnap-dkms should be still possible easy/fast build/install blksnap module on them (is also possible build/install it manually without dkms)
  - debian 8 and ubuntu 14.04 needs to install cmake 3 from backports to build
